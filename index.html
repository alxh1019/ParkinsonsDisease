    <h1>Indicators of Parkinson's Disease</h1>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p>
       Parkinson's disease affects millions worldwide, often going undetected for years before visible motor symptoms appear.
        In this webpage, data of motor indicators of Parkinson's disease via existing studies compile data visualizations in hopes to guide users in understanding this disease.

    <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
        This project integrates multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive view of the indicators of Parkinson's Disease.
        Below is an overview of the data sources used in our analysis.
